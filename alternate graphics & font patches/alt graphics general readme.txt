These patches will let you play the game with alternate fonts, absolute minimal use of multi-letter font glyphs, and character/enemy graphics and colors.
Please refer to each addendum's readme and PNG files for preview.

The IPS patches only work with a patched, no-header version of FF4 Ultima.
Not all of them are compatible together!
