Beta 8 (10/3/24)

- Updated a host of dialogue based on recent reports.

- WiP on improving Member's Pass Seller NPC trade quest.


NOTES FOR CHILLY:
Member's Pass quest is obtuse and gives no hints. Redesign necessary, requiring some event flag changes to point at different text.

Interaction:

IF NO "Member's Pass"

Bank 1 Msg 489: "Wanna see a fun show? I'll trade you the Member's Pass for something good." // unrelated, but this will change to strengthen the quest

THEN DISPLAY YES/NO PROMPT

IF NO

Box closes

IF YES

Open item-trading window.

IF GIVE ANYTHING BUT SILVERFRUIT

Bank 1 Msg 21: "Nothing happened."

IF GIVE SILVERFRUIT

Bank 3 Msg 113: "Oh!" AUTO-CLOSE MSG AFTER SEVERAL SECONDS

DISPLAY NEW MESSAGE

Bank 1 Msg 495: "Have a good time!" // we want this to be Bank 2 Area 25 Msg 7: "That looks tasty and expensive! Here, take a pass free of charge. Just keep this under your hat..."

IF YES MEMBER'S PASS

Bank 2 Area 25 Msg 1: "This city is paradise..." // we want this to be Bank 2 Area 25 Msg 9: "Y'all come back again, now!"


Also, Bank 2 Area 25 Msg 3: "I'm never leaving!!" will change to add a hint to this trade: "She keeps raising Member's Pass prices... At this rate, she'll ask for edible silver."

Beta 1 (8/6/24):

- Incorporates chillyfeez's "Plus" beta from February 2024.

- Script is on par with Project II v3.05, with further script refinements based on my improved writing skill. (This included porting over several, but not many, enemy names.)

- Most Ultima-exclusive event dialogue rewritten in the same style as Project II.

- Several lore term modernizations to accurately represent FFIV's story, making it accessible to modern players as a result. This affected the currency, the recurring metal, 4 spells, 2 items, 2 side character names, and 6 locations.

- Descriptions of items, equipment, and magic have been rewritten to avoid non-standard squish tiles. The same treatment happened to battle messages.

- Optimizations to take advantage of various squish tiles, e.g. "Boomerang" and "HiWind."

- Corrected several textual inconsistencies.

- New fire, lightning, ice, tail, stun, star, holy, and dark icons. (Thanks chillyfeez for ice, and xJ4cks for everything else)

- Title screen versioning updated.
