Final Fantasy 4 Ultima Plus
Style Packs, v2024

curated & compiled by xJ4cks
----------------------------
Hello, please apply these patches directly over a copy of FF4 Ultima Plus and you will change many of the graphics and the font!
(These are made to work only with this version of FF4 Ultima.)

contents:
- Mercury patch and manifest
- Venus patch and manifest
- Mars patch and manifest
- Jupiter patch and manifest
- Saturn patch and manifest
- Neptune patch and manifest
- Pluto patch and manifest

Overall style rules:
- Mars has the original game font, the rest have alternates
- rocky planets have 'SquishBGone' fonts, so some items and spells are renamed
- outer planets have "FF Record Keeper" style battle sprites
- inner planets have original game battle sprites (vanilla)
- Neptune and Pluto have the oddest color alts for the characters
