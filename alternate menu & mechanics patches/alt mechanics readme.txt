--- Final Fantasy IV - Ultima - Sylph-Bloodfeast Fix.ips ---

This fixes the Sylph/Bloodfeast bug.

1) If Rydia is in the center slot, summoning Sylph does not deplete her MP. This patch corrects that and Rydia's MP depletes normally.

2) If another character uses Bloodfeast while Rydia is in the center slot, Rydia will take the current MP of the character using the item. This could either be harmful or beneficial depending on the character's MP. If the character has an MP of 0, it'll deplete Rydia's completely after the item use. But, if a the character has a high amount of MP, then it could potentially mean a free refill of Rydia's MP. This patch fixes this issue also and Rydia's MP will no longer br affected by Bloodfeast usage.

The ips patch only works with a patched, no-header version of FF4 Ultima.

--- Final Fantasy IV - Ultima - Remove Multiple Hit Attack Animation.ips ---

Use this patch to remove the Multiple Hit Attack Animation feature that's added to Final Fantasy IV - Ultima. This feature displays the amount of hits during an attack reflective of the Attack Multiplier. The higher the Attack Multiplier, the more 'Swings' displays on an attack. This patch removes that and reverts the attack animation back to vanilla.

The ips patch only works with a patched, no-header version of FF4 Ultima.

--- Final Fantasy IV - Ultima - Remove Bestiary Arrows.ips ---

Starting at v2022 rev21, ARROWS have been added in the Bestiary screen to indicate to the player they can navigate to different monsters using the D-Pad. Inadvertently, the extra arrows can block a monster's graphics if it's big enough. This patch is to remove the arrows on this screen for those that wish to see the monster sprites in its entirety.

The ips patch only works with a patched, no-header version of FF4 Ultima v2022 rev21 and on.
