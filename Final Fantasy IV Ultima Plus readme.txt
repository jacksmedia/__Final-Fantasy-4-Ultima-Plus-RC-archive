Description:
---------------------------------------------------------
FFIV is one of the greatest games in the series, and is one of my favorites. However, the version we got always felt lacking in extra content. The base game had a lot going for it, and was full of potential - a great soundtrack, lovable cast of characters, and the ATB battle system that is second to none in the series... but I have always wanted MORE of FFIV! That was the reason for this hack. It started out as a personal project for myself, but when it was completed, I decided to release to the public. Hope everyone enjoys it!
This hack adds new content to the base game, while keeping the main story intact and the feel of FFIV SNES the same.
This hack aims to be a 'deluxe' version of FFIV.
